\begin{abstract}
In 2016, Dedre Gentner won the 'Turing Award' of Cognitive Science, i.e., the David E. Rumelhart Prize for Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition, for her foundational work on Structural Mapping Theory (SMT). The theory describes how humans progressively discover relational abstractions across alignable objects; the studies that test and flesh out the theory span everything from attentional biases to key sensemaking activities like mental model formation and analogical transfer. <transition?> Gestalt principles of visual perception distill psychology theory and experimentation into concise descriptions of factors that influence how humans are likely to parse and understand a given 'scene', e.g., a bias towards connecting discrete elements based on continuity, proximity, or closure; designers consider these principles' predictions when creating interfaces. Following the Generative Theories of Interaction framework, we derive additional design principles that distill the knowledge of human cognition captured in SMT and suggest ways to operationalize it to help users quickly understand the relationships \textit{between} objects in the scene. These principles are validated by analyzing previous HCI and Visualization works' fulfillment or violations of these principles and how users were or were not able to use them for SMT-relevant tasks.

\section{Introduction}

In an early paper on what was to become Structural Mapping Theory (SMT), \citet{} described how, perhaps counterintuitively, psychology studies predicted that humans can more easily list differences between two different mugs than between a mug and an alligator. Why? Especially when, objectively, a mug and an alligator are so much more different than two mugs! The punchline is that humans subconsciously look for latent structural mappings between objects that might be related; it can, for example, help them notice anomalies, like a subtle difference that distinguishes a poisonous mushroom from a nutritious one, and, perhaps most critically for abstract thought, learn abstractions from concrete examples and leverage those abstractions to parse and interpret new examples.

Prior work in user interface design for large (and small!) corpora, e.g., OverCode~\cite{}, Foobaz~\cite{}, Examplore~\cite{}, Exempla Gratis~\cite{}, ParaLib~\cite{}, MOCHA~\cite{}, PATAT~\cite{}, ``MesoText''~\cite{}, AbstractExplorer~\cite{}, and CorpusStudio~\cite{}, have implicitly or explicitly been designed to support this structural mapping process in users' minds when organizing and presenting piles of related objects. Some of these prior works have attempted to simulate the structural mapping process algorithmically and then present the pre-mapped results to users so that they do not have to mentally compose a mapping themselves. Others compute non-obvious abstract relationships between objects irrespective of how they fit together into a global mapping and modify objects' rendering to make the corresponding related components of objects more visually similar as well, with the hope that it will give users' mental 'structural mapping engines' (SMEs)~\cite{} a leg up. (Note that these and other strategies are not mutually exclusive.)

The core activity these systems enable---and the process of producing this work---are both dialectical activities~\cite{brewer}. \citet{dialecticalzhang} characterizes Brewer's concept of dialectical activities as repeated re-engagement that reveals value. For example, \citet{2025DTRAnnualLetter} characterizes research as just such a dialectical activity, i.e., ``re-examining a phenomenon intensely. [...] A process of looking at and continually reinterpreting a situation that we come to see it differently, and through which we build new understanding. It’s not so much about following a set of `scientific steps' as a means of producing something, as it is about looking at something repeatedly with unrelenting curiosity that eventually allows new understanding to emerge.''

Structural Mapping Theory describes an analogous largely subconscious process---at the level of human attention, perception, and cognition---where objects in relation to each other are parsed and re-parsed using different possible representations, mentally aligned and re-aligned using different local and global relational abstractions, drawing attention to the similarities and distinctions between aligned components across objects, possibly inspiring new more rich, latent, or generalizable mental representations and abstractions by which to align some or all of the related objects being considered.

This paper is also the result of repeated re-engagement: with our prior work, related work, and Structural Mapping Theory. Guided by the Generative Theories of Interaction (GToI) framework, we analyzed both the SMT literature and the empirical evidence from prior user studies of systems to compose principles for user interface design when users are going to see and reason about many related objects. Specifically, the second author assisted the first author in collecting and understanding both the formative and summative SMT literature and composing an initial set of principles. These principles were used by authors three through N to analyze prior works' fulfillment or violation of these principles, and its impact on users as captured by those works' evaluative user studies. Disagreements due to misunderstandings were used to clarify principles' descriptions while all other disagreements were used to refine the principles themselves and their expected domain of applicability.

In an age of our rapidly increasing ability to delegate to AI, this work attempts to capture how we can support human cognitive engagement with large and small collections of semi-structured data, and the benefits users reap when they do.

In summary, we contribute:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A concise description of Structural Mapping Theory, a key theory of human cognition, for the HCI community
    \item Theory- and empirically-backed principles for user interface design that support users' reasoning about many related objects
    \item An analysis of key past HCI papers with respect to these principles
    \item The demonstration of a process for deriving principles using the Generative Theories of Interaction framework \todo{see if other folks described their process}

\section{Background}

% \subsection{Dialectical activities}

% In his CHI'24 paper on how consequentialism has influenced HCI, \citet{dialecticalzhang} characterizes Brewer's concept of 'dialectical activities' as repeated re-engagement that reveals value. In his 2025 DTR Annual Letter~\cite{}, he characterizes research as just such a dialectical activity, i.e., ``re-examining a phenomenon intensely [...] a process of looking at and continually reinterpreting a situation that we come to see it differently, and through which we build new understanding. It’s not so much about following a set of `scientific steps' as a means of producing something, as it is about looking at something repeatedly with unrelenting curiosity that eventually allows new understanding to emerge.''

\subsection{Established Gestalt Principles}


\subsection{Structural Mapping Theory (SMT)}

\section{Methodology}

\section{SMT-Informed Extended Gestalt Principles}

\paragraph{Definitions}
In the description of these principles, we will use some common terms defined here:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Objects in a collection: the entities of which there are at least two; together they form a collection, e.g., code examples collected into a corpus~\cite{paralib}. %It could be the original objects in a collection, e.g., code examples collected into a corpus~\cite{paralib}, or it could be objects in a collection that have been transformed in some way, or it could be compound objects
    \item Structure: objects with structure can be broken down into \textit{components and relations between them}. For example, if the object is a sentence, it could be broken down into a sequence of text segments~\cite{abstractExplorer}. 'Sequence' describes the relationships between consecutive components, i.e., text segments. %Two clarifying anti-examples are: (1)
    The sentence could also be represented by a `bag of words', but that would be a structureless representation. %(2) The sentence could be described by a vector, e.g., in an embedding space. The vectors could themselves be considered transformed versions of the objects in a collection. %, but any interface that presents the vectors as objects would not translate into facilitating relational abstractions over the original sentences unless the transformation from sentences to vectors was structure-preserving and could be mapped back to the sentences easily---ideally perceptually.
    \item Components: %objects that have structure can be described by components and relationships between those components.
    Components of an object can have analogous components in other objects; that cross-object component mapping is determined by the alignment process in the user's mind and/or executed by the system algorithmicly.
    \item Relational Abstractions:
    
\end{enumerate}

Visual comparison can reveal the shared structure of objects in a collection.\todo{describe relationship to schema induction, mental modeling, learning, relational abstractions, etc.} The following principles facilitate this process.

\subsection{Collection level: Show the objects without abstracting away relevant structure.}
\todo{(Principle "-1")}
Any object structure that is abstracted away becomes impossible to form relational abstractions about.
%Without being able to see the objects, the structure of objects cannot be compared, and relational abstractions can not be composed.
For example, representing a collection of documents as dots in some scatter plot does not support the forming of relational abstractions across documents because the dot representation abstracts away the structure of the document it represents.

That said, relational abstractions inspired by similarities and differences between objects that are not both visible at the same time requires a sufficiently accurate memory of the currently unseen object to compare to; the relational abstractions that occur to the user may be limited by the (possibly evolving) mental representation of the unseen objects in memory. And objects that are never shown cannot influence the relational abstractions in their mind.
%While that vector is structured, representing the document as a dot in some 2-or-3D projection of that vector space is not a structured representation because the dot has no structure.

\todo{do we need permission to reprint figures of these interfaces in the appendix? Or do we want folks to go to the original papers? What about just a close cropped figure in the text to illustrate what we mean, or maybe an illustration that recreates the part of the interface we're 'pointing' to? I like that last option a lot, though it's more time consuming.}

\subsubsection{Artifact analysis}

\paragraph{Artifacts that fulfill this principle}

\textbf{Text Corpora} PaTAT~\cite{patat} and MOCHA~\cite{mocha} both show all the text in the collection being labeled in its entirety.
\textsc{ChainForge}~\cite{chainforge} fulfills this principle by showing the raw textual outputs of LLM queries. So do the grid and interleaved renderings of the LLM outputs grouped by Positional Diction Clustering in \citet{mesotext}. \textsc{Tempura}~\cite{tempura} fulfills this principle by showing all the raw textual queries made by search engine users. \todo{make sure it's all; fix it if it's not.}  \textsc{Serendyze}~\cite{serendyze} shows the entirety of the short texts in the corpus. %\todo{If Tempura and Serendyze don't both show all items in the corpus, does it only partially fulfill this principles? What if many are visible at once but not all?}
\textbf{Code Corpora}Both \textsc{Examplore}~\cite{examplore} and \textsc{ParaLib}~\cite{paralib} fulfill this principle by showing both all the code examples in the corpus in their entirety. (\textsc{Examplore} also shows all the code examples filtered to just include the structural components captured in the 'skeleton' abstraction that the system designers believed really mattered.) \textsc{OverCode}~\cite{overcode} showed the solutions to python programming problems in their entirety, modulo individual students' less common variable names and equivalent statement orders, and \textsc{Foobaz}~\cite{foobaz} re-expanded the abstracted away dimension of variable names, where all alternative student-chosen names for a particular variable role are visible.

\paragraph{...and corresponding user study results}

\paragraph{Artifacts that violate this principle, and corresponding user study results}

\subsubsection{Artifact critique: Artifacts that do and shouldn't or don't but should fulfill this principle}

\subsection{Component level: Compute and reify \textit{local} identity, relational, and/or conceptual matches.}
\todo{Principle 0a-c}

\paragraph{Elaboration on the wording of the principle itself}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Local:} The intention of this prinicple is to support early steps in the alignment process illustrated in \Cref{fig:4-1}. However, since local identity, relational, and conceptual matches are computed without reasoning about possible global structural alignments, e.g., based on literal similarity alone, this can help Step 1 of users' internal SME's (\Cref{fig:4-1}) but also interfere with latter steps, e.g., Step 2 (\Cref{fig:4-1}) by getting in the way of identifying more latent structural similarities and differences if local matches between components that are not mapped to each other in any small submappings (kernels) cannot melt away or be selectively dismissed to allow for just focusing on matches between corresponding components within valid increasingly global submappings.
    \item \textit{Reify:} Display these local relationships such that their corresponding matches within other objects are clearest perceptually with the minimal possible additional cognition. Whether this is achieved is not dictated by any simple rule, e.g., unique visual variables for each relationship, but rather the intersection of multiple principles, as examples below may clarify.
\end{enumerate}

Identity matches are analogous to \texttt{===}, not \texttt{is} or \texttt{==}. In this analogy, the type coercion that \texttt{==} would impose before testing for equality suggests equating \texttt{My name is Harry} with \texttt{Harry is my name}. This would be too liberal a definition of an identity match: even thought the semantics are, in this case, unambiguously the same, the literal text is different. For natural language, this strict definition can, in general, preserve distinctions in meaning as well as stylistic distinctions and subtle differences in possible implied meanings. Legal contexts are where---to the untrained eye or large language model---subtle differences in language can result in significant differences in meaning, e.g., \texttt{will} versus \texttt{shall} as demonstrated in the Supreme Court ruling on IP agreements with universities~\cite{}. Word choices in news articles can have more sublte impacts on the understanding readers walk away with, e.g., whether a particular administration official or entity \texttt{labeled} or \texttt{determined} China a currency manipulator~\cite{triangulating}---the former suggests name-calling while the latter suggests some information-based decision process. The identical or even simply similar meaning of two or more sentences can be reified using common labels (Principle TBD).

In contrast, in programming languages where semantics are generally deterministic, identity matches can be relaxed by the system designer if, for example, they are designing for teachers and they confirm with their intended users that there is no pedagogical benefit to preserving the order of arguments to a communative operator such as \texttt{area = height*width} and \texttt{area = width*height}. Similarly, the first author would argue that, by default, \texttt{CO2} and \texttt{Carbon Dioxide} are not literally the same visual representation, and their identical semantic meaning can be reified as a 'common label' (principle tbd) but the system designer may determine that treating them like identity matches is better for the user, e.g., the cognitive and perceptual work for the task at hand is reduced or the particular cross-object relationships that the user wants to key in on are easier to notice.

\todo{note for ian: I've always wanted these abstractions to be able to be constructed by the user. reminds me of your notations stuff.}

For example, consider the following four sentences, with the visual variables of the text modified to reify pre-computed (overlapping) identity, relational, and conceptual matches:\\
\diffont{\colorbox{SkyBlue}{\textit{\textbf{M}ichael \textbf{J}ordan}}} \underline{is} \underline{a} \underline{basketball player}.\\
\diffont{\colorbox{SkyBlue}{\textit{\textbf{M}agic \textbf{J}ohnson}}} \underline{is} \underline{a} \underline{basketball player}.\\
An up-and-coming \underline{basketball player} \underline{is} \diffont{\colorbox{SkyBlue}{Victor Wembanyama}}.\\
Despite being tall, \diffont{\textit{Ari Ofsevit}} \underline{is} not \underline{a} \underline{basketball player}.\\

\texttt{Michael Jordan} and \texttt{Magic Johnson} are not identity matches at the token level; at the character level their leading characters are identity matches reified with text boldness. (If the system designer believes sub-token identity matches are helpful, they can reify them; otherwise they can stay at the level of comparing whole tokens. It is up to the system designer to assess what is most helpful to the user given the data and the task.) They, as well as Victor Wembanyama, are all basketball players though so they can be considered conceptual matches (here, reified via blue highlighting). The text segments \texttt{Michael Jordan} and \texttt{Magic Johnson} also have the same structural relationship to the rest of the object they are each a part of (the sentence)---so they are a relational match as well, reified via italicization).

The first author would argue that the text segments \texttt{Ari Ofsevit} shares the same structural relationship with the rest of its sentence, i.e., also the sentence subject in a subject-verb-object type of sentence, despite the fact that (1) the rest of the sentence being, content-wise, the opposite meaning of the rest of the sentences that \texttt{Michael Jordan} and \texttt{Magic Johnson} show up in and (2) the sentence \texttt{Ari Ofsevit} is in has an extra structure component: a leading dependent clause.

The \underline{is a basketball player} portions of the sentences are an identity match as well between the first two sentences; however, when considering the third sentence, it can make sense to break the component underline{is a basketball player} into multiple components, some of which are identity matches across all three sentences (\underline{is} and \underline{basketball player}) and some of which are only present as identity matches in the first two (\underline{is}, \underline{a}, and \underline{basketball player}). A continuous underline beneath \underline{is a basketball player} and \underline{basketball player is} could suggest an equivalence between them that does not help readers notice a missing word whose absence would change the meaning of the underlined portion.

Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Victor Wembanyama, and Ari Ofsevit are all people, so they are conceptual matches reified with a different font. In this example, the first, second, and fourth sentences have a clear structural mapping to each other (shared kernel)\todo{check usage of this term} while the third sentence, if we do not allow transformations of natural language sentences even if they are likely to perserve semantics, does not share the same structural mapping. As suggested by the eye-tracking study in AbstractExplorer~\cite{abstractExplorer}, reordering the sentences to group them by shared kernel would facilitate cross-document skimming amongst those willing to be guided by these pre-computed relationships rather than reading sentences one at a time in their entirety and comparing them cognitively. \todo{consider putting third sentence last} If re-ordering data by shared kernel so that such objects are aligned with each other (princple TBD) with no competing barriers (principle TBD) is not possible, allowing local matches that cross kernels to be dismissed can support folks in the cognitive process represented in \Cref{fig:4-1} rather than interfere with it with spurious local similarities. That said, calling these local matches regardless of whether or not there are possible alignments may facilitate the human discovering a different representation that makes it possible to align the objects, such that these local matches become matches between corresponding components.


\todo{add somewhere: in way that is more preferred, given typical and/or developed* human cognitive characteristics, and makes these local matches become matches between corresponding components... *experts may have developed structures, like those that enable master chess players to reason about chess moves at a higher level than individual pieces, that affect their preferences in a way that contradicts generic preferences for systematicity, etc.}

While the \texttt{M}'s, \texttt{J}'s, \texttt{is}'s, \texttt{a}'s, and \texttt{basketball player}'s are all identity matches, and the visual variables, i.e., text boldness and underlines, that denote the identity matches between the corresponding instances in the sentences are not unique, the first two sentence's parallel alignment with minimal oblique angles between the corresponding identical letters and words in the sentences (see Principle TBD) strongly suggests the correct mapping, i.e., from bold letters and underlined words in the first sentence to bold letters and underlined words in the second sentence, without requiring the human to search over possible mappings themselves, rather than simply perceiving the matches. Extending this correct mapping to the fourth sentence for the \texttt{is}'s, \texttt{a}'s, and \texttt{basketball player}'s is possibly slightly interfered with by the competing barrier, the third sentence (princple TBD). The local identity matches between the third sentence and the other three sentences, i.e., \underline{is} and \underline{basketball player}, require human visual search to perceive the mapping, though the simple fact that \underline{is} and \underline{basketball player} are underlined indicates that they are at least a local identity, relational or conceptual match to something else in the collection, which can therefore be known perceptually without search, though that knowledge does not directly help with the mental process these principles are designed to support: structurally mapping representations of objects in a collection to each other.

In an expanded example of the first two lines, we can superimpose reasoning about identity matches at the level of visual comparison of the literal text, and reason about the meaning of the text:\\
\textit{\colorbox{SkyBlue}{\textbf{M}ichael \textbf{J}ordan}} \underline{is a basketball player.} \pinkhighlight{Sam} \underline{likes \colorbox{SkyBlue}{him}}.\\
\textit{\colorbox{SkyBlue}{\textbf{M}agic \textbf{J}ohnson}} \underline{is a basketball player.} \pinkhighlight{Amy} \underline{likes \colorbox{SkyBlue}{him}}.\\
The blue and pink highlights call out two conceptual matches between the two lines, i.e., corresponding 'actors' \colorbox{SkyBlue}{\texttt{<Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson>}} and \pinkhighlight{\texttt{<Sam,Amy>}}, and extending the blue highlights to the textual references in the two lines (\colorbox{SkyBlue}{\texttt{<him, him>}}) in addition to using a visual variable that confirms the identical match between the \texttt{him}'s does turn what could be a cognitive computation into a perceptual one at both the literal and symbolic level.

This cognitive reading and comparison work is trivial (and barely worth doing) for two sentences, but across tens or hundreds of short documents (or more!), this can be crucial to not falling victim to wall of text-triggered disengagement. The same may be true of other data types at significant scales, but given that reading is not an innate skill but rather taught and text, unlike, for example, images, must be literally read and \textit{then} its meaning abstractly interpreted, the wall-of-text phenomenon can happen particularly quickly. Even if noticing commonalities and differences all the objects in a collection is not the conscious, stated goal of a given user, it is a pre-condition to common user goals, e.g., forming a mental model of the collection's contents.

Note that, when computing and reifying local identity, relational, and/or conceptual matches across objects, the system designer will be implicitly defining what counts as an object if they do not do this explicitly. For example, the system designer can indicate relationships between the original objects, e.g., as shown above between two sentences; between transformations of the original objects, e.g., between programming statements with normalized argument orders for commutative operations; between objects about the original objects, e.g., between common bigrams extracted from a collection of documents; and between ``enhanced'' objects, e.g., objects whose representation has been expanded with metadata, like a prepended element indicating the sentiment of a sentence, as in Serendyze~\cite{serendyze}.\todo{consider moving}

\paragraph{Artifacts that fulfill this principle}
While ChainForge~\cite{chainforge} does not fulfill these principles, \citet{mesotext} implemented novel methods on top of ChainForge to evaluate the utility of fulfilling this principle for collections of LLM outputs like those ChainForge is built to generate, i.e., multiple responses of multiple LLMs to the same or even systemically varied queries, such as 10 responses from 3 different LLMs to the question \texttt{Tell me about \{college\}} for multiple values of \texttt{\{college\}} like \texttt{Princeton}, \texttt{Penn State}, and \texttt{IIT Madras}. Specifically, \citet{mesotext} highlighted local identity matches (the 'Exact Matches' feature) \todo{check that language},

% For example, consider the following two lines:\\
% \texttt{Michael Jordan is a basketball player. Sam likes him.}\\
% \texttt{Magic Johnson is a basketball player. Pat likes him.}\\
% These two lines have can be represented as structured objects.
% One structured representation of these two lines is as a sequence of sentences. With that view, the first sentences are relational matches to each other, as in \textit{both the first of two sentences in a line}, as are the second sentences. This forms a complete structural mapping or alignment between the two objects (lines):\\
% \textit{Michael Jordan is a basketball player.} \textbf{Sam likes him.}\\
% \textit{Magic Johnson is a basketball player.} \textbf{Pat likes him.}\\
% Within each corresponding sentence, there are more possible matches. For example, in the first sentences:\\
% \textit{\textbf{M}ichael \textbf{J}ordan} \underline{is a basketball player.}\\
% \textit{\textbf{M}agic \textbf{J}ohnson} \underline{is a basketball player.}\\


%with the visual variables of the text modified to reify pre-computed (overlapping) identity, relational, and conceptual matches between the two lines:\\
%\textit{\textbf{M}ichael \textbf{J}ordan} \underline{is a basketball player.} \textit{Sam} \underline{likes him}.\\
%\textit{\textbf{M}agic \textbf{J}ohnson} \underline{is a basketball player.} \textit{Pat} \underline{likes him}.\\
%In the first sentences of each line, Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson are not identity matches at the token level; at the character level their leading characters are identity matches. (If the system designer believes sub-token identity matches are helpful, they can reify them; otherwise they can stay at the level of comparing whole tokens. It is up to the system designer to assess what is most helpful to the user given the data and the task.) They are both basketball players though so they could be considered conceptual matches. They also have the same structural relationship to the rest of the object (the sentence) they are a part of---so they are a relational match as well. The \underline{is a basketball player} portions of the sentences are an identity match as well.

---
reintegrate the rest:

Consider the second sentences of each line: \texttt{likes him} is an identity match between the two second sentences and a relational match, as the verb and object ending the sentences. But \texttt{him} also refers to two different basketball players; while the

Considering both lines in their entirety, the corresponding relational/conceptual matches \texttt{<Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson>} and \texttt{<Sam, Pat>} are both reified in italics, but again their spatial proximity to each other through the parallel alignment of the sentences keeps the human from seeing the mapping as ambiguous, and so unique reifications are not necessary.

%In general, we do not reason about references of text because we are solely concerned with visual comparison, so the \texttt{him}'s, which refer to different people, are identity matches. If

As a reminder, while the \texttt{M}'s, \texttt{J}'s, and \texttt{is a basketball player}'s are all identity matches, and the text boldness that denotes the identity matches between the corresponding \texttt{M}'s and \texttt{J}'s in the two sentences are not unique. However, the sentence's parallel alignment with minimal oblique angles between the corresponding identical letters in the sentences (see Principle TBD) strongly suggests the correct mapping from bold letters in the first sentence to bold letters in the second sentence without requiring the human to search over possible mappings themselves, rather than simply perceiving the matches.

% ConsIn another example below, we do not reason about references of text because we are solely concerned with visual comparison:\\
% \textit{\textbf{M}ichael \textbf{J}ordan} \underline{is a basketball player.} \textit{Sam} \underline{likes him}.\\
% \textit{\textbf{M}agic \textbf{J}ohnson} \underline{is a basketball player.} \textit{Pat} \underline{likes him}.\\

%At the end of the day, given the data and the task, the system designer gets to decide the level of abstraction at which identity matches are determined.

%At some point, the system designer gets to decide what counts as an object match. :)

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{SMT as dialectical constant}
\citet{2025DTRAnnualLetter} defines a dialectical constant as ``a consistent structure whose repeated use can promote a deepening of engagement in dialectical activities such as research.''

\pagebreak

As noted in the introduction, the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can
be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a
double-anonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''
journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by
selecting the appropriate {\itshape template style} and {\itshape
  template parameters}.

This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide} is
available from
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

\subsection{Template Styles}

The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{acmsmall}}: The default journal template style.
\item {\texttt{acmlarge}}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item {\texttt{acmtog}}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{sigconf}}: The default proceedings template style.
\item{\texttt{sigchi}}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item{\texttt{sigplan}}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Template Parameters}

In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{anonymous,review}}: Suitable for a ``double-anonymous''
  conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
  numbers. Use with the \texttt{\string\acmSubmissionID} command to print the
  submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
\item{\texttt{authorversion}}: Produces a version of the work suitable
  for posting by the author.
\item{\texttt{screen}}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\end{itemize}

This document uses the following string as the first command in the
source file:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf,authordraft]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
  modifications are discovered.}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.
