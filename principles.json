For example, people who compare simultaneously presented visual examples of heat-flow are more likely to notice the common phenomena than are those who describe the visuals separately, suggesting that comparison highlights commonalities (Kurtz, Miao, & Gentner, 2001). Visual comparison can also highlight differences (Gentner et al., 2016; Sagi, Gentner, & Lovett, 2012). For example, medical students who compared X-rays of diseased lungs with those of healthy lungs were subsequently better able to identify focal lung diseases in further X-rays (Kok, de Bruin, Robben, & van MerriÃ«nboer, 2013).",
