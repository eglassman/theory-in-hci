# Theory in HCI

Theories, i.e., testable hypotheses (predictions) stated in the maximally general way to facilitate accurate predictions across the most diverse concrete situations possible, are a form of knowledge that is both summative and generative. When their predictions are fulfilled, they provide explanations for observations. When their predictions are violated, it's an opportunity to suggest refinements to the theory itself, e.g., the boundaries of its applicability. Theory can be collectively refined over unbounded time-scales by many independently operating researchers. Without engaging in theory, a field is at risk of generating thousands of papers that each produce units of knowledge, but do not result in much greater possible accumulated and even replicated higher-level knowledge, like the difference between a pile of a thousand bricks and a thousand bricks arranged to create a functional structure.

Theory in HCI is particularly challenging because it is a manifold field: anywhere at least one human and one computational element are interacting, HCI knowledge is relevant. This poses many problems: 

First, there are many different entire fields of research about humans alone and together---with their own concepts, theories, and frameworks---that have implications for HCI. It's currently difficult to keep up with the many concepts, theories, and frameworks currently used in HCI, let alone those that are relevant from other fields but not yet known in HCI. And HCI is not unique in this respect; researchers in these other fields probably also do not know every concept, theory, and framework in their own field.

Second, for a given theory, a researcher can (1) misunderstand the theory, (2) derive incorrect or suboptimal actionable principles [e.g., using Generative Theories of Interactions methodology], (3) fail to correctly identify whether aspects of a given situation or intervention satisfy an actionable principles or not [analysis of artifacts stage of Generative Theories of Interactions] (4) fail to recognize the applicability of an actionable principle in a given situation or intervention [critique of artifacts stage of Generative Theories of Interactions] (5) poorly instantiate an actionable principle within a given intervention [constructive stage of Generative Theories of Interactions] (6)

from which HCI researchers can derive actionable principles to inform HCI work [e.g., using Generative Theories of Interactions methodology] and test hypotheses [e.g., by instantiating novel interfaces that follow those principles and evaluating their impact on humans].
